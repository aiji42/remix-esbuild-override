## How to write commit messages

We use [Conventional Commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to automate version management.

Most common commit message prefixes are:

* `fix:` which represents bug fixes, and generate a patch release.
* `feat:` which represents a new feature, and generate a minor release.
