# Remix with [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) (css props) on Cloudflare

The base template is [here](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/examples/emotion), and the configuration under the app directory is the same as this one, with @emotion/styled changed to css props.
This example is for Cloudflare Workers, but it is basically the same for any runtimes.

To adopt a writing style that uses css props requires a few tricks. The official documentation describes a solution with the babel plugin, but that method is not available for Remix projects. You can also solve this problem by writing the jsx pragma at the beginning of the file, but this is more complicated and has the disadvantage that the fragment short hand (`<></>`) is not available.  
Since @emotion/server relies on Buffer, it cannot run if Cloudflare is used as the runtime.

## Use remix-esbuild-override

Use remix-esbuild-override and the plugin for polyfill to solve the problem.

1. Install and setup `postinstall`

```bash
npm install -D remix-esbuild-override @esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill
# or
yarn add -D remix-esbuild-override @esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill
```

update `scripts > postinstall` in package.json

```json
"scripts": {
  "postinstall": "remix setup cloudflare && remix-esbuild-override"
}
```

2. Update tsconfig.json

```
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "@emotion/react", // <= this line
    "moduleResolution": "node",
```

3. Create the shims file and update remix.config.js

Create `reactShims.ts` at the project root.

```ts
import { jsx } from "@emotion/react";
import * as React from "react";
export { jsx, React };
```

Update remix.config.js

```js
const { withEsbuildOverride } = require("remix-esbuild-override");
const path = require("node:path");
const GlobalsPolyfills =
  require("@esbuild-plugins/node-globals-polyfill").default;

withEsbuildOverride((option, { isServer }) => {
  option.jsxFactory = "jsx";
  option.inject = [path.resolve(__dirname, "reactShims.ts")];

  // ðŸ”½ This block is for Cloudflare Workers/Pages. ðŸ”½
  if (isServer) option.mainFields = ["browser", "module", "main"];
  option.plugins = [
    GlobalsPolyfills({
      buffer: true,
    }),
    ...option.plugins,
  ];
  // ðŸ”¼ This block is for Cloudflare Workers/Pages. ðŸ”¼

  return option;
});

/**
 * @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig}
 */
module.exports = {
  serverBuildTarget: "cloudflare-workers",
  server: "./server.js",
  devServerBroadcastDelay: 1000,
  ignoredRouteFiles: [".*"],
  // appDirectory: "app",
  // assetsBuildDirectory: "public/build",
  // serverBuildPath: "build/index.js",
  // publicPath: "/build/",
};
```

That is all. Now you can write styles in css props.

# Welcome to Remix!

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

You will be running two processes during development:

- The Miniflare server (miniflare is a local environment for Cloudflare Workers)
- The Remix development server

Both are started with one command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787) and you should be ready to go!

If you want to check the production build, you can stop the dev server and run following commands:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

Then refresh the same URL in your browser (no live reload for production builds).

## Deployment

Use [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler) to build and deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers. If you don't have it yet, follow [the installation guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update) to get it setup. Be sure to [authenticate the CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/authentication) as well.

If you don't already have an account, then [create a cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and after verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your dashboard and set up your free custom Cloudflare Workers subdomain.

Once that's done, you should be able to deploy your app:

```sh
npm run deploy
```
